InAppSettings is an open source iPhone and iPod touch framework for displaying an in app 
version of the settings from the Settings.bundle. 

There has been a lot of debate over whether an app's settings should be in the app or in 
the Settings app. InAppSettings is an open source framework determined to remedy this 
situation once and for all by easily allowing developers to have the same settings in the 
Settings app in in their app.

InAppSettings uses the same Settings.bundle so there is no duplication of files or work. 
Simply add InAppSettings to the app's project and call the InAppSettingsViewController from 
code or Interface Builder and you're done! The InAppSettings wiki contains a full guide, 
including example code, for adding InAppSettings to an iPhone or iPod touch app.

How to Add InAppSettings to Your App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Drag InAppSettings into your project in Xcode.
2. Import InAppSettings.

#import "InAppSettings.h"
    
3. InAppSettings has two view controllers:
    · InAppSettingsViewController - should be used within an existing UINavigationController.
    · InAppSettingsModalViewConrtoller - creates its own navigation controller, with 'done' 
        button, for modal views.

Example code for InAppSettingsViewController:
- (IBAction)showSettings{
    InAppSettingsViewController *settings = [[InAppSettingsViewController alloc] init];
    [self.navigationController pushViewController:settings animated:YES];
    [settings release];
}

Example code for InAppSettingsModalViewController:
- (IBAction)presentSettings{
    InAppSettingsModalViewController *settings = [[InAppSettingsModalViewController alloc] init];
    [self presentModalViewController:settings animated:YES];
    [settings release];
}

InAppSettings can also be used in Interface Builder by changing the class type of a UIViewController 
to InAppSettingsViewController.

InAppSettingsModalViewController should not be used in Interface Builder.

InAppSettingsTestApp implements InAppSettingsViewController both ways, and shows how to use 
InAppSettingsModalViewController.
