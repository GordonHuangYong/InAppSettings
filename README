How to Add InAppSettings to Your App
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Drag InAppSettings into your project in Xcode.
2. InAppSettings is just a view controller called InAppSettingsViewController, you can use it just like you would any other view controller.

example:
- (IBAction)showSettings{
    InAppSettingsViewController *settings = [[InAppSettingsViewController alloc] init];
    [self.navigationController pushViewController:settings animated:YES];
    [settings release];
}

Or InAppSettings can be called from a nib by changing the class type of a UIViewController to InAppSettingsViewController.

InAppSettingsTestApp implements InAppSettings both ways.

Please note that in order for subviews of InAppSettings to work InAppSettingsViewController must be added to a navigation controller.
